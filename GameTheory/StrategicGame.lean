The meet of an indexed family of endorelations (aka preference profile)
is the agreement of all members.
In game theory terms this is the 'Pareto improvement' relation.

Two important operations on endorelations:
- given a relation on Y and a function X → Y, pullback to a relation on X.
- given a relation on Y and a point x, pullback to a relation on X → Y.

/-

In a zero-sum game with at least 2 players and all preferences reflexive and anti-symmetric,
every outcome is Pareto efficient.

Proof:
- If x is not Pareto efficient, there exists strict Pareto improvement x'.
- So any two distinct players i, j weakly prefer x ≤ x'.
- By zero sum, since i weakly prefers x ≤ x' then j weakly prefers x' ≤ x.
- By reflexivity x = x', contradicting strict improvement.

/-

First definition of a normal-form game based on the notion of utility, consisting of:

- a set of players,
- a set of strategies (assumed to be the same for all players),
- a set of possible 'utility' values,
- a 'play' function which maps strategy profiles to utility profiles, where
  - a 'strategy profile' is a choice of strategy for each player,
  - a 'utility profile' is an assignment of utilities to each player; and
- a preference relation on utility values, assumed to be shared by all players.

For example the utility could be a numerical value
and all players agree "more is better" (for themselves).

Note the 'play' function wraps what is usually called the 'payoff matrix'.

Example: prisoner's dilemma.

It is a utility game with 2 players {0, 1}, 2 strategies {true, false} (defect or not),
and 4 possible scores/utilities (sometimes described as costs / negative utilities).
The Nash equilibrium is for both to defect.
